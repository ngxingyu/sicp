He led us in starting out on\nthis enterprise and wrote the first set of subject notes from which\nthis book evolved.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p4","child":[{"body":"\nMuch of the style and aesthetics of programming that we try to teach\nwere developed in conjunction with Guy Lewis Steele Jr., who\ncollaborated with Gerald Jay Sussman in the initial development of the\nScheme language.  In addition, David Turner, Peter Henderson, Dan\nFriedman, David Wise, and Will Clinger have taught us many of the\ntechniques of the functional programming community that appear in this\nbook.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p5","child":[{"body":"\nJoel Moses taught us about structuring large systems.  His experience\nwith the Macsyma system for symbolic computation provided the insight\nthat one should avoid complexities of control and concentrate on\norganizing the data to reflect the real structure of the world being\nmodeled.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p6","child":[{"body":"\nMarvin Minsky and Seymour Papert formed many of our attitudes about\nprogramming and its place in our intellectual lives.  To them we owe\nthe understanding that computation provides a means of expression for\nexploring ideas that would otherwise be too complex to deal with\nprecisely.  They emphasize that a student's ability to write and\nmodify programs provides a powerful medium in which exploring becomes\na natural activity.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p7","child":[{"body":"\nWe also strongly agree with Alan Perlis that programming is lots of\nfun and we had better be careful to support the joy of programming.\nPart of this joy derives from observing great masters at work.  We are\nfortunate to have been apprentice programmers at the feet of Bill\nGosper and Richard Greenblatt.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p8","child":[{"body":"\nIt is difficult to identify all the people who have contributed to the\ndevelopment of our curriculum.  We thank all the lecturers, recitation\ninstructors, and tutors who have worked with us over the past fifteen\nyears and put in many extra hours on our subject, especially Bill\nSiebert, Albert Meyer, Joe Stoy, Randy Davis, Louis Braida, Eric\nGrimson, Rod Brooks, Lynn Stein, and Peter Szolovits.\nWe would like to specially acknowledge the outstanding teaching\ncontributions of Franklyn Turbak, now at Wellesley; his work\nin undergraduate instruction set a standard that we can\nall aspire to.\nWe are grateful to Jerry Saltzer and Jim Miller for\nhelping us grapple with the mysteries of concurrency, and to\nPeter Szolovits and David McAllester for their contributions\nto the exposition of nondeterministic evaluation in chapter~4.\n","tag":"#text"}]},{"tag":"TEXT","id":"#p9","child":[{"body":"\nMany people have put in significant effort presenting this material at\nother universities.
